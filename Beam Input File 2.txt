# Lines starting with a # character are comments to be ignored
# You may have comment lines anywhere in the file

# blank lines are also allowed and will be ignored

# Other lines in the file are identified by specific KEYWORDS, followed by data
# KEYWORDS may include Capital letters, but capitalization must not be required
# each line stands alone, and there is no required ORDER to the file

# Loads - might be point loads or point moments
#         Sign convention:  up is positive for point loads
#                           clockwise is positive for point moments

#	    If you wish to place a Load at the end of the beam, you may
